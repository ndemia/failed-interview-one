# Failed interview test
As part of the process for a junior position at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create a program that would check the last flights that the user searched for, and if any, show the last 3 of them on the website when it loaded next time. Main condition was that the code had to work from the console. That was a challenge for my limited knowledge at the time. The website used localStorage to save previously searched flights and design-wise, it had to blend with the rest of the website. I managed to make it work, but the main issue with my code was that it was not scalable and had some hard-coded values (because I couldn't make it work otherwise, silly me). Still, for someone coming from another discipline, I felt proud of what I achieved. Didn't get the job.

So as practice, I'm replicating a dummy version of the airline's website in order to, then, be able to recreate the orginal test, just for fun.
