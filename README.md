# Failed interview test
As part of the process for a junior position at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create a program that would check the last flights that the user searched for, if any, and show the last 3 of them on the website when it loaded. Main condition was that the code had to work from the console. That was a challenge for my limited knowledge at the time. Maybe even now. But for the rest, fairly simple. Design-wise, it had to blend with the rest of the website. Managed to make it work, but the main issue with my code was that it was not scalable and had some hard-coded values (because I couldn't make it work otherwise). Still, for someone coming from another discipline, I felt proud of what I did.

So as practice, I'm going to replicate the website (although at a much much smaller scale and simpler), and do the test. Should be fun.
