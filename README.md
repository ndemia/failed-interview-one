# Failed interview test
As part of the process for a junior position at a digital marketing agency, they gave me the website of an airline to work on. The task was to create a program that would check the last flights that the user had searched for, and show the last 3 of them on the website when it loaded next time. The main condition was that the code had to work from the console, as it were injected.
The airline website used localStorage to save previously searched flights, and design-wise, the results had to blend with the rest of the website. I managed to make it work, but the main issue with my code was that it was not scalable. Also I had to use some hard-coded values (due to my limited knowledge at that time). Still, for someone coming from another discipline, I felt proud of what I achieved. Didn't get the job.

So as practice, and fun, I'm replicating a dummy version of a airline's website in order to, then, be able to recreate the orginal test.
